# Causal_Convex_Hull
## Core Description
- A structural dimensionality reduction method based on Causal Convex Hull (CCH) for efficient and unbiased estimation of causal effects (e.g., ATE) in high-dimensional Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- The baseline method refers to the causal graph reduction approach proposed by Guo et al. (2023). The original R code repository: https://github.com/richardkwo/reduceDAG. This project has reimplemented it in Python, and the code is stored in the `baseline_methods/` directory
